Replicant is an in-progress video decoder for the high color VQA video
files from the 1997 Blade Runner PC game from Westwood Studios.

It's written in c99, because, well, I thought it'd be fun to not do
it in c++.

Currently you just give the program a .MIX from Blade Runner and it'll
dump every frame of every VQA to a png, courtesy of the smashing
LodePNG library from http://lodev.org/lodepng/

All the fun stuff is happening in BRVQAReader.c.

There's an 8-bit VQA-file in Blade Runner. That format is well
documented and will be supported soon.

Once the video decoding is flawless and it's been wrapped in a
"proper" video player with sound support, I'll probably start digging
into the other chunks from the game.

I've compiled it with clang on Mac OS X and TinyCC on Windows.
Visual Studio doesn't support C99 - complain to Microsoft.

DrMcCoy thought up the name. Thanks Doc!
