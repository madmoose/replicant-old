Replicant is an in-progress video decoder for the high color VQA video
files from the 1997 Blade Runner PC game from Westwood Studios.

It's written in c99, because, well, I thought it'd be fun to not do
it in c++. The object pattern is half-assedly based on Apple's
CoreFoundation.

I've compiled it with clang on Mac OS X and TinyCC on Windows.
Visual Studio doesn't support C99 - complain to Microsoft.
Just compile togeter all the .c files that you can find.

DrMcCoy thought up the name. Thanks Doc!
